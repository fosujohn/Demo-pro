# Status Codes




Once a REST API receives and processes an HTTP request, it will return an HTTP response. Included in this response is an HTTP status code. This code provides information about the results of the request. An application sending requests to the API can check the status code and perform actions based on the result. These actions could include handling errors or displaying a success message to a user.
