The advancement in technology in the twenty first century has introduced new and
exciting ways for artists to self-promote their artwork while traditional methods remain
viable. To be competitive in the art market an artist must understand and implement a
variety of marketing strategies. Effective marketing is particularly critical for an art
teacher who is also a practicing artist in order to sell their artwork. Through a
comparative analysis of readily available marketing tools for artwork, I explore in this
study a variety of ways that an artist can establish a successful career in art through the
use of technology, and create a roadmap that can be used to shorten their route.
